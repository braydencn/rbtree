Just another red black tree. 
The tree node insert/delete implementation is located in rbt.c file. 
Some testcases are setup in rbt_test.c.

To run the test, try with 'gcc -o rbt rbt.c rbt_test.c && ./rbt'. 
This will create trees with 100 random numbers; then delete node from root/max node/min node/child of root. 
It will check all the red-black tree rules after each insert/delete. 
The test will be repeated for 10000 times.

The red-black tree rules are:
1. rbt_node should be either black or red;
2. root is black;
3. all leaf rbt_nodes(NULL) are black;
4. red rbt_node only has black children;
5. all simple paths from one rbt_node to all of its leaf rbt_nodes contain the same number of black rbt_nodes.
